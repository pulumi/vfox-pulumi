# Vfox Lua Stubs

Mise creates lua libraries through rust, so the types are not available while developing (only at runtime).

These stub types were generated so that LSP would work against these vfox libraries. Generated from the rust implementations [here](https://github.com/jdx/mise/tree/611df82a07779c76e7cb60bbcd1f7d0993fabb0e/crates/vfox/src/lua_mod).
